## Project Objective
To create a Social Network API using a NoSQL database, so that the website will handle large amounts of unstructured data; we will be able to add, update, delete and view specific information using the POST, PUT, DELETE AND GET methods. The specific information that we will be manipulating will be a user, a friend for a user, a thought for a user, a reaction for a thought. Also whenever we delete a user, their associated thoughts will do as well!
